 This was a good intro on how to use the basic features of Onshape. It was fairly simple, but Onshape's mechanics are slighly different than Solidworks, so it's good to start slow. I want to focus on becoming proficient at utilizing the keyboard shortcuts. They seem extemely useful for navigating Onshape quickly, so I want to learn them as soon as possible.
