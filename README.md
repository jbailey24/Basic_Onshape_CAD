<p>Configurations are definitely a lot easier to access and use in Onshape. It’s great that you can make and edit the configurations in one tab. I will admit that the mating feature is starting to get on my nerves. Yes, in SolidWorks it takes a few more clicks, but at least I can do it efficiently. In Onshape, I had to click on each mate connector several times before it registered and mating the second pin in the joints required rotating the frame piece on the secondary axis to reach the correct mate connectors instead of just clicking and rotating the piece. However, I’m still just starting out, and who knows, I could turn out to like it in the end.</p> 
<p>After I assembled everything, I wanted to add a bit of interest to the frame, so I chamfered the inside front edge and added an extruded rectangle on the back. To do this, I was just going to add those features to my frame part, but the way I assembled the frame, two of the pieces were facing backwards. Instead of redoing all of those mates to turn the pieces around, I decided it would be more fun to add another configuration for “side 1” and “side 2”. I made the chamfer and extrusion on both sides, and then suppressed them accordingly to make two mirrored configurations. Then, I just went into the assembly, double clicked on the frame pieces I wanted to rotate, and clicked change configuration. It was perhaps not the most efficient way to do that, but oh well, now my frame looks nice.</p>


## Caster
### Base

 This was a good intro on how to use the basic features of Onshape. It was fairly simple, but Onshape's mechanics are slighly different than Solidworks, so it's good to start slow. I want to focus on becoming proficient at utilizing the keyboard shortcuts. They seem extemely useful for navigating Onshape quickly, so I want to learn them as soon as possible. 
 
### Mount

I have similar comments as I had for the last part. One thing that I will note is that it would have taken me a bit of searching to find the variable button (on Chromebooks it's hidden under a dropdown menu), so I'm glad that was pointed out - global variables (or are they just called variables in Onshape) are a very helpful tool to have. 

### Fork

As I've been doing this more, I find I'm able to get into a rhythm of making and extruding sketches quickly. The chamfer, fillet, and mirror tools all seem easy to use.

### Tire

This part was really quick and simple. I think it's pretty neat that the dimension tool allows you to dimension by the diameter as well as the radius. 

### Wheel

It's really cool how sketches can be extruded and revolved with multiple closed shapes! Using Onshape, it makes me wonder why SolidWorks is so picky about the single closed shape thing. The way Onshape is set up makes much more sense and it cuts out the extra time it takes to trim the lines into one shape.

### Axle, Collar, and Bearings

Very simple parts, but can I just say, I'm having a great time chosing a color palette for this caster. Also, fun fact that I accidentally learned, you can turn on the construction tool while using the "use" feature. It made my sketch look much neater when I was centering the hole in the collar.

### Wheel and Axle Assembly

The Onshape's mating system is definitely interesting. Clicking on the correct mate connector was a bit tricky, esspecially on the wheel, but overall it made sense. The animate feature was super fun (and presumably useful in the future too).

### Final Assembly

All done! I had some trouble getting the pins in place, but other than that it went smoothly. I really like how all of my parts and assemblies are in the same document. It makes it easy to switch between all the parts and it means that my Onshape home page isn't cluttered up with a bunch of documents. Overall, Onshape seems like a fun, intuitive, and effective program, and I'm glad I'll be able to branch out from SolidWorks a bit.
