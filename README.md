 This was a good intro on how to use the basic features of Onshape. It was fairly simple, but Onshape's mechanics are slighly different than Solidworks, so it's good to start slow. I want to focus on becoming proficient at utilizing the keyboard shortcuts. They seem extemely useful for navigating Onshape quickly, so I want to learn them as soon as possible.

I have similar comments as I had for the last part. One thing that I will note is that it would have taken me a bit of searching to find the variable button (on Chromebooks it's hidden under a dropdown menu), so I'm glad that was pointed out - global variables (or are they just called variables in Onshape) are a very helpful tool to have.

As I've been doing this more, I find I'm able to get into a rhythm of making and extruding sketches quickly. The chamfer, fillet, and mirror tools all seem easy to use.

### Tire

This part was really quick and simple. I think it's pretty neat that the dimension tool allows you to dimension by the diameter as well as the radius. 

### Wheel

It's really cool how sketches can be extruded and revolved with multiple closed shapes! Using Onshape, it makes me wonder why SolidWorks is so picky about the single closed shape thing. The way Onshape is set up makes much more sense and it cuts out the extra time it takes to trim the lines into one shape.

### Axle, Collar, and Bearings

Very simple parts, but can I just say, I'm having a great time chosing a color palette for this caster. Also, fun fact that I accidentally learned, you can turn on the construction tool while using the "use" feature. It made my sketch look much neater when I was centering the hole in the collar.
