 This was a good intro on how to use the basic features of Onshape. It was fairly simple, but Onshape's mechanics are slighly different than Solidworks, so it's good to start slow. I want to focus on becoming proficient at utilizing the keyboard shortcuts. They seem extemely useful for navigating Onshape quickly, so I want to learn them as soon as possible.

I have similar comments as I had for the last part. One thing that I will note is that it would have taken me a bit of searching to find the variable button (on Chromebooks it's hidden under a dropdown menu), so I'm glad that was pointed out - global variables (or are they just called variables in Onshape) are a very helpful tool to have.
